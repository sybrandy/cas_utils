# CAS_Utils

This is a collection of various utilities that I created.  A short description
of each is as follows:

## jsgrep

jsgrep is a small utility written using the D Programming Language to grep
JSON files.  This was created to be able to view parts of a JSON document
quickly and easily.  It is designed to be similar to grep from a command-line
perspective.  It only filters of fields and not values as my current use case
was to see what values are in one or more documents.
